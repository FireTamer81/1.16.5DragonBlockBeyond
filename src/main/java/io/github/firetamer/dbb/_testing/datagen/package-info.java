 * I have no idea why it's not working other than perhaps forge.
 * I didn't have this problem before starting this project, which I started form scratch with a new MDK using the newest suggested version.
 *
 * However, no need to fix it at the moment since it isn't really needed (no more many hundred JSONs from the warenai block stuff thanks to baked models)
 *
 * P.S. The stuff below is just a test, please ignore
