 * There is also the {@link io.github.firetamer.dbb.modules.to_do} package which has things that have absolutely no work done on them yet that are really just there because an idea
 * needed to be jotted down. Please try to avoid having to many unfinished projects (I'm one to talk) to avoid confusion and delay
