/**
 * TODO:
 *     - Add in a noise deformation thing to add spires like often seen on namek
 *
 *     - Make the underwater plants and features actually spawn underwater
 *
 *     - Add in that "seaweed fruit" or whatever it was I was attempting with the namek kelp. I think it was based off of subnautica's creepvine
 *
 *     - Add in the Entities, a fair few.
 *
 *     - (Probably for a machine feature) Add in a machine to process the namek kelp berries, ajisa flowers, and namek water into healing fluid.
 *
 *     - Perhaps have a way for namek water to turn into normal water outside of the namek dimension and vice-versa.
 *     - Same for other namek plants, but instead they turn into a dead variant
