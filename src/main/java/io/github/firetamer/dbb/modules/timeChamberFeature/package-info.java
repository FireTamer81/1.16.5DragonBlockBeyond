 * Things to do:
 *     Build the actual time chamber structure
 *
 *     Add the time chamber structure in a way where it only ever spawns at 0, 0

 *     Make the portal mechanics for the door.
 *
 *     Make some way of adding the "glitching" or "breaking" mechanic the further into the chamber one gets.
