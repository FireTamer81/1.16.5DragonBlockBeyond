This module will be for machines of various purposes.

Might have a "3D printer" for making things like armour, clothings, etc.

Might have a capsule manufacturer for capsule items, perhaps some of them having pre-maid kits within them and all that,

A healing liquid refinery from those few Namek items.

A warenai block refinery and cutter for making the various blocks without the creation skill

A paint mixer for paintable blocks (Mostly for warenai blocks since they have practically infinite color choices.)
