/**
 * This is where GUI stuff will go:
 *     Any Helper classes
 *     The Main Screens and their children organized respectively to avoid confusion
 *     Anything used to activate those GUIs unless it is say a block from another feature.
 *     Etc.
 *
 *
 *
 * At the moment all I have worked on is the Main Player GUI (which I plan to eventually replace the vanilla inventory with).
 *
 * Other GUIs planned are:
 *     Player Customization Screen (which might open on world creation or brand new players to a server AND in game for multiple "player profiles")
 *     Paint Mixer Screen (Will have a color picker thingy to fully utilize all 16 Million+ colors :)  )
 *     Story Customization Screen for when the story system stuff is done (might be like the resource pack screen, removing and adding downloaded stories)
